# ML Algorithm Kaggle Competition Word Complexity
 The final solution submited to a Kaggle Competition for Word Complexity (AI)


## What was the problem:

Predicting which words are considered hard to understand for a given target population is a vital step in many Natural Language Processing applications such as text simplification. A system could simplify texts for second language learners, native speakers with low literacy levels, and people with reading disabilities. This task is commonly referred to as Complex Word Identification. Usually, this task is approached as a binary classification task in which systems predict a complexity value (complex vs. non-complex) for a set of target words in a text. In this challenge, the task is to predict the lexical complexity of a word in a sentence. A word which is considered to be complex has label 1, a word is considered to be simple (non-complex) has label 0.

## Short description

The 2 main classifiers used were Gaussian Naive-Bayes and KNN and used around 13 different features from word based, token based or sentence based. More information about the function implementation can be found in the .docx file, which is the Documentation of the contest. The final results on the Public Leaderboard were: 0.78989 with an extra submission from a friend's account (Grigore Paul Bogdan) 0.79020, which means rank 25.
